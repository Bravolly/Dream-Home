# Dream Home - Your Future Home is Here

- A website where people can find their next home from reliable agents

Dream Home is a real estate website designed for individuals looking for their new dream home
and real estate agents selling potential dream homes. Users will be able to browse, search, or
filter for their potential new home. They can also contact the real estate agent directly from our
website and manage contacted agents with the Dream Home Dashboard. Real estate agents
will be able to post new listings for sale, manage their listings with their own dashboard, and
communicate directly with buyers from their Seller dashboard.

Dream Home was created with usability in mind. We understand that searching online for a new
home can be stressful and confusing so we’ve chosen to keep features to a minimum and
straightforward. Users won’t be bombarded with an overwhelming number of choices, just a few
simple options. Dream Home also helps buyers keep track of all the real estate agents they
have contacted with the Dream Home Dashboard. Users don’t need to worry about losing
contact information or forgetting which homes they were interested in since all their potential
dream home information is stored on one easy-to-use website.

Real estate agents will also love their Seller Dashboard since it stores all potential buyers for
each listing. Agents can message buyers directly from their Seller dashboard, so they can
assure they are contacting the correct buyer about the correct home.

Dream Home will be competitive with other real estate websites since it will contain common
features of other real estate websites, but Dream Home will be more user friendly. By
eliminating unnecessary features that other real estate websites have, Dream Home will be
easier for users to search for homes and contact sellers.

Our team of student software engineers is dedicated to creating a high quality real estate
website for our users. Some of our team members have industry experience, but all of us have
the passion and hard work it takes to make Dream Home the perfect place to find your new
dream home.
